## Introduction

In today's data driven world, machine learning has become a powerful tool for extracting the valuable insights from complex datasets. However, the complexity associated with setting up and understanding machine learning models often pose a challenge to entry for many individuals, especially those without solid technical background. As a result, in this project, we aim to address this issue by providing a user-friendly simulation of a machine learning pipeline using R Shiny. Through this platform, users can gain more intuition about how machine learning algorithms work, further enhancing the productivity in their learning process.

### Problem Statement.

The complexity of machine learning often deters individuals with non-technical backgrounds from exploring its potential applications. Traditional machine learning platforms require programming knowledge and familiarity with complex algorithms, limiting their accessibility to a niche audience. Our goal is to democratize machine learning education by creating a platform that simplifies the process of building and understanding machine learning models, making it accessible to a wider audience.

### Dataset Description.

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and is often used for introductory purposes due to its simplicity and well-defined structure. It was introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his paper "The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems" in 1936.

The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each belonging to one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. For each sample, four features were measured:

- Sepal Length: Length of the sepals (the green leaf-like structures that protect the flower bud) in centimeters.
- Sepal Width: Width of the sepals in centimeters.
- Petal Length: Length of the petals (the colored part of the flower) in centimeters.
- Petal Width: Width of the petals in centimeters.

The target variable in the Iris dataset is the species of each iris flower, which is categorical and can take one of three possible values:

- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

The Iris dataset is commonly used for supervised learning tasks, particularly classification, where the goal is to predict the species of an iris flower based on its four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width). It serves as an excellent dataset for learning and practicing classification algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, etc.

## Justification of Approach

Our approach focuses on leveraging the power of data visualization and interactivity to simplify the machine learning process. By providing a visual and intuitive interface, users can interact with different components of the machine learning pipeline, gaining a deeper understanding of how data is processed and models are trained. This approach differs from traditional machine learning platforms, which often require users to write code and understand complex algorithms without visual aids.
