# COMP4010 - Data Visualization - Project 2 - Proposal

**Group G: Dinh Van Thanh, Do Huu Dat, Ha Phuong Thao**

## High-level Goal

Our goal in this project is to make machine learning more inclusive, by developing a simple, automated and interative machine learning pipeline, from data preprocessing, feature engineering,... to model evaluation and development. We hope to be able to leverage the learning experience with machine learning by visualizing machine learning algorithm and creating intuitive understanding.

## Project Description

In this project, we aim to demonstrate the principles and behaviors of machine learning algorithms with visualization. Our target algorithms in this project include, but not limited to, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression.

This project presents an exciting opportunity to apply the knowledge acquired in the Data Visualization course to a real-world application. In addition to demonstrate accurately and clearly the behavior of each algorithm, ensuring the quality of the visualization itself is also our main goal. By leveraging the visualization techniques such as annotation and following the POUR principles while developing application, this application is expected to provide great user-experience and usability to all individuals, including those with disabilities.

By implementing the application with R-shiny, we really hope to bring a great learning experience to user. This R package includes essential modules supporting visualization and interactivity, aiming to provides an elegant and powerful web framework for building web applications.
