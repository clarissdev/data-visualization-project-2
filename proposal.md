# COMP4010 - Data Visualization - Project 2 - Proposal

**Group G: Dinh Van Thanh, Do Huu Dat, Ha Phuong Thao**

## High-level Goal

Our goal in this project is to make machine learning more inclusive. We hope to be able to leverage the learning experience with machine learning by replicating a simple machine learning pipeline and creating intuitive understanding.

## Project Description

Our project aims to offer a user-friendly simulation of a machine learning pipeline using R Shiny. Through interactive modules, users can upload datasets of their choices, preprocess data, select and train machine learning algorithms, and evaluate model performance. This platform provides a hands-on learning experience, making machine learning concepts accessible to a wide audience. By democratizing access to machine learning education and experimentation, our project equips users with valuable skills for data-driven decision-making in various industries.

This project presents an exciting opportunity to apply the knowledge acquired in the Data Visualization course to a real-world application. The motivation behind this initiative is to provide a user-friendly, visual interface where users, regardless of their technical background, can experiment with and visualize how different machine learning algorithms process data and yield predictions. By simplifying the complexity typically associated with setting up, coding, and tuning machine learning models, this platform seeks to bridge the knowledge gap and make these powerful tools more accessible to non-specialists, including students, educators, and professionals in non-technical fields. In this project, we aim to introduce the simplest machine learning algorithms with visualization, which include, but not limited to, Linear Regression, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression.
